# Data Sheet: Dual-AAV Retinal Gene Designer PoC Outputs## Dataset nameDual-AAV Retinal Gene Designer PoC Outputs (MYO7A, ABCA4)## MotivationThe datasets in this repository capture design-factor panels, proxy QC scores, and ranked candidate constructs for oversized retinal gene therapy payloads delivered via dual-AAV strategies. They are intended to support transparent decision-making, reproducible ranking, and clear mapping from design variables to validation assays.## CompositionPrimary outputs include:- Ranked candidate tables (top-N per program)- Model metrics summary (if enabled)- Permutation/feature importance table (factor contributions)- Figures showing key trade-offs (size vs expression, risk vs expression, Pareto plots)- Linear cassette drawings for selected A/B half-vectors## Data sources- Generated synthetically by the PoC scripts in this repository.- No patient data, no identifiable information, and no clinical datasets are included.## Collection processOutputs are produced by running the PoC scripts that:- enumerate a design-of-experiments panel across factors- compute proxy QC and performance scores- apply gates for integrity, fidelity, stress, and developability- rank candidates and export tables and figures## Recommended uses- Compare candidate constructs in a transparent, factor-driven manner.- Create internal review-ready artifacts for decision meetings.- Build structured wet-lab validation plans (assay mapping and checklists).- Communicate rationale to cross-functional stakeholders.## Uses to avoid- Do not treat proxy scores as validated predictors of in vivo efficacy or safety.- Do not use outputs to guide clinical decisions.- Do not claim manufacturing readiness from these proxies alone.## Distribution and splitsIf you use this PoC to generate train/test splits for learning-to-rank or regression experiments, document:- random seed- split strategy (by gene, by promoter, by platform)- any holdout constraints to prevent leakage across similar designs## Potential biases and failure modes- Proxy rules can encode designer assumptions (for example, promoter targeting strength, stress penalties).- Simplified cell context models can underrepresent real retinal lineage diversity.- Sequence-level risks are represented as abstracted features, not full motif scanning on actual sequences.## Maintenance- Record the script version and random seed in the manifest JSON.- Keep a changelog if factor definitions or scoring weights are modified.## ContactMaintainer: Mark I.
