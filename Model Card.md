# Model Card: Dual-AAV Retinal Gene Designer PoC (MYO7A, ABCA4)## Model detailsThis repository implements a proof-of-concept scoring and ranking workflow that simulates and prioritizes dual-AAV construct design options for oversized retinal gene therapy payloads. It produces proxy predictions for full-length protein recovery, truncation burden, stress/toxicity burden, and a program-aligned functional proxy across retinal cell contexts (RPE vs photoreceptor-like). The workflow is designed for MYO7A (USH1B) and ABCA4 (Stargardt disease) as reference use cases.**Model type:** rules + proxy simulation + ranking (not a trained clinical model).  **Primary outputs:** ranked candidate designs, QC proxy scores, and decision artifacts.## Intended use- Prioritizing construct architectures under AAV capacity constraints.- Comparing design factors (promoter, UTR, polyA, intron, split fraction, junction modules) under explicit gates.- Producing decision-grade planning outputs (assay mapping, checklists, and visualization-ready cassette maps).## Users- Gene designers, molecular biologists, translational scientists, and R&D teams working on retinal gene therapy design planning.## InputsDesign factor settings, for example:- program_gene: MYO7A or ABCA4- target_cell: RPE or PR (photoreceptor-like)- promoter, UTR class, polyA class, intron inclusion- split fraction and balance mode- platform/junction logic toggles (conceptual)- sequence QC risk toggles (conceptual)## OutputsPer design:- Proxy scores: size/developability, processing fidelity, stability risk, CpG burden- Performance proxies: full-length protein, truncation burden, stress burden, functional proxy- Gate-pass flag and rank- Exported figures/tables and linear cassette drawings for top candidates## EvaluationBecause the workflow is a PoC using synthetic proxies, evaluation focuses on:- internal consistency (expected directionality of factors)- stability under random seeds- interpretability (feature importance and Pareto trade-offs)- face validity checks aligned with known AAV constraints and RNA processing risks## Limitations- Proxies do not replace empirical measurements and are not validated predictors of in vivo efficacy.- No manufacturing QC or biodistribution modeling is performed.- Cell-type specificity is modeled as a simplified promoter-targeting proxy, real biology is more complex.- The SD/SA and junction logic are represented conceptually; real sequence context can dominate outcomes.## Ethical considerationsThis repository is intended for research planning and educational purposes. It does not provide clinical guidance. Construct designs produced here must be evaluated under appropriate biosafety, ethics, regulatory, and quality frameworks before any translational use.## Caveats and recommendationsUse this PoC to generate hypotheses, narrow panels, and structure validation plans, then validate with:- full-length vs truncation assays (protein integrity)- localization assays (cellular correctness)- stress/toxicity readouts (therapeutic window)- functional readouts aligned to MYO7A/ABCA4 biology- manufacturability and vector genome integrity assays during development
